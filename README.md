# ChazzieMeSs (CMS)

Welcome to ChazzieMeSs, a fully customizable, headless Content Management System (CMS) built with Nuxt 3. Designed for developers who crave flexibility and control, ChazzieMeSs allows you to edit every aspect of the code, enabling you to tailor your CMS to meet any project requirements. Embrace the power of a headless architecture and enjoy the seamless integration, scalability, and performance that comes with it. Whether you're building a small blog or a large-scale application, ChazzieMeSs provides the tools you need to create and manage content with ease.

## Origin story

ChazzieMeSs was born out of a personal need to create a simple CMS for my mom's high-end clothing store website, which I host and manage, with the goal of enabling her to handle basic tasks herself. Initially, her site was built on Joomla and later transitioned to WordPress. However, I found these platforms to be overly bloated and complex, especially for someone not actively using these tools. My goal was to develop a user-friendly CMS that simplifies the essential tasks: creating a brand, adding products, and editing site content per page. ChazzieMeSs aims to offer an intuitive experience, eliminating the steep learning curve and unnecessary features of traditional CMS platforms.

To make the CMS more appealing to my mom, I chose to use pink as the primary color, which is her favorite color.

## Folder structure

To maintain a clear and organized project setup, ChazzieMeSs recommends having two primary folders at the root level: `/cms` and `/web-app`. The CMS folder contains all the code and resources related to the ChazzieMeSs headless CMS, allowing you to manage and customize your content management system independently.
